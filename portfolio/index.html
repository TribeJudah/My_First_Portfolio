                    <p>Hey there! I'm Terry, a software engineering, data science and analytics enthusiast. In the hopes of becoming a fullstack engineer, I'm currently an active learner of Front-end Developer program organized by alx dedicated to designing intuitive, and high-performance web experiences. Having learned some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I transform ideas into elegant digital solutions, and continuously learn from other front end engineers all over the world to hone my skills and contribute meaningfully to developments. When I take breaks from being "serious", I read, listen to music or indulge in sports with friends.</p>
